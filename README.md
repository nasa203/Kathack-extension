# Kathack-Extension
Chrome extension that revives [Kathack](https://kathack.com/). Originally created by Alex Leone, David Nufer, and David Truong, the original bookmarklet no longer works because web browsers have become picky.


## Note
I do not own this, everything belongs to the original creators of this bookmarklet.
Also, this extension uses manifest V2
